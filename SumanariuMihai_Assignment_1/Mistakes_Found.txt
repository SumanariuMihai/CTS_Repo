Mistakes Found

1. "assignment" name for package does not respect conventions ->  renamed into "ro.ase.stud.assignment"
2. "Account" class name not specific -> renamed into "BankLoanAccount"
3. Variables should be written on different lines for clarity
4. "loan_value" variable, "_" is used for constant variables along uppercase -> renamed into "loanValue"
4.1. same for "account_Type" -> "accountType"
5. "rate" is not a specific variable -> renamed into "interestRate
6. "loan" is not a specific function -> renamed in "getLoan"
7. "getMonthlyRate" function - if it is needed in all classes by the lead, it makes much more sense to exist in an interface
		-> Created "MonthlyRateGettable" interface that contains the "getMonthlyRate" abstract method
	- also at this function, I put spaces between variables and "*" sign for clarity
8. "setValue" function 
		- name not specific -> changed into "setLoanValue"
		- parameter "value" not specific -> changed into "newLoanValue"s
9. exception "Exception" used in function and constructor does not respect Clean Code conventions
	 -> created new "InvalidLoanRateException", imported and used it instead
	 -> where this exception exists, now testing for positive instead of negative (inverted the if-else)
10. function "to_string" is using too much memory from initialising strings, changed into a StringBuilder
11. function "print" does literally nothing, so I didn't know how to correct it 
		-> put the content in comment form and thrown an exception until Dev explanains what that was for
12. found a hard coded value -> added it into an outsourced function to be changed there, not in our function
13. the spacing on that function is horrid, repaired its' aesthetics
14. function is overcrowded - changed it into multiple functions
15. mathematical formula is repetitive, used common factor
16. "calculate" function name not specific -> changed it into "calculateTotalFee"
17. found hard coded value "365", deduced it is the number of days and made it into a "DAYS_IN_YEAR" constant
18. pointless lines found in function -> initialising temp as 365, initialising an account and working with it instead of accounts[i] -> deleted all
19. whatever names I changed for variables, I changed the constructor parameters accordingly
20. Constructor can use the setter instead of having another exception

*. found some TAB-key presses where there should be space presses, changed
