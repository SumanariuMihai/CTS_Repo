Bachelor Thesis - CRM for B2B Business

I might not be creative enough, but I honestly do not find a use for an adapter.
Well, I do find a use - creating an adapter in order to implement additional actions for any field in the database, which is its' general purpose.
Problem is I don't know what new actions to add or why would I not add them in the first place for all fields.

Post-doing this, I had the idea of making the field more protected through this, so I will use this at proxy as well
